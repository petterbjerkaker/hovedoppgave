# main-project

## Purpose of main project
The purpose of the main project was ignited through the author's own interest in running. Therefore, a fictional event seemed suitable as a way 
of displaying some of the abilities learned throughout the semester. This made the process of working with this project both engaging and 
very educational. While the author of this project has arranged events with his running club in previous years, there has not been an event
of such great proportion. Having been able to work on a project originating from own interests has been a pleasure. 


## Content of main-project
The content of the main project consists of five webpages in total. The front-page, the registration-page, the contact-page, 
the information-page, and the inspiration-page. All webpages have a device breakpoint at maximum width 600px, meant for the mobile device. 

### Content of front-page
Functioning as a focal point in user experience and the design of the front-page, the initial view is a top image and the header. The Melhus IL-logo at the left of the header, 
is clickable and will redirect the user to the front-page. The Nike-logo is a fictional sponsor, which redirects the user to Nike's running division webpage. 
The header is identical for each webpage.
The front-page consists of a minimal amount of text and information, as the front-page is meant to ignite the user's interest, and not to be exposed to an overwhelming amount
of information from the start. The user then has the option to choose and select more information later in the front-page. 
Another reason for the lack of text is that the user should be able to navigate swiftly when encountering a front-page, and then instead be able to have alternatives 
as to what the user wants to encounter next. 
The top image gives the user a feeling of what this webpage is about, and the header introduces the user to the fictional event's name.
Next, the user encounters a slideshow consisting of a total of six images. Each image is from the town of Melhus, giving them relevance to the event. 
The slideshow can be clicked through with previous and next buttons, however, there is no dragging function. The slideshow does not have dots to redirect the user
to specific images, however, there is a counter which keeps the user informed of what image is displayed, and how many there are in total. 
At the end of the front-page, the user encounters four different containers, containing each of their short descriptions and button. When clicking a button, the user is 
redirected to the new webpage in a new tab. 
Here, the user may select what is most interesting to explore further. 

### Content of registration-page
The registration page consists of a form and radio inputs. The registration form and radio inputs are validated. If the user tries to sign up without all inputs having content, 
an error-message will show.
If all inputs have content, and one of the radio inputs has been chosen, a success-toast will appear. 

### Content of contact-page
The contact page consists of a contact form. The contact form is validated. If the user tries to send a message without having all inputs filled, 
an error-message will show.
If all inputs have content, and the text-area has content, a success-toast will appear. 

### Content of information-page
The information page consists of no functions, apart from the header's redirections. 
General information about the fictional event, and information for each of the races is written on this webpage. 
Each race has its own section with information, and its own image displaying the race trail. 
The images consists of three different symbols along the race trail, and is also explained further in the informative sections. 
This webpage was made independently, so that the user may seek out and choose to find more information. Both general and more specific information, 
rather than being overwhelmed by it when navigating through the front-page. 

### Content of inspiration-page
Here, the filter-function has been applied. The user is exposed to all races and distances initially. Then, the user can click on either marathon, half-marathon,
or 10-kilometres, to filter the list to show a specific distance, rather than every type of race. 
Each distance has an assigned button. The button named all distances functions as a reset-button, or clear-button, if clicked when displaying a specific race distance. 
The all distances-button displays all races, as it is displayed when the user first encounters the page without having clicked on anything specific. 
All images are clickable, and will redirect in a new tab the user to find more information about the specific distance targeted.
