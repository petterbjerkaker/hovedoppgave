			<p>The Melhus Marathon was established in 2024. The races are meant for anyone, and are not specific nor restricted to runners who are members of running clubs. 
				<br>
				This initiative was brought forward as a result of the town Melhus’ rapid increase in population. Melhus Marathon stands as a symbol for uniting the town’s residents, 
				<br>
				and to bring attention towards our fair town nationwide. Each of our races are up-to-date regarding security-, and medical attention-measures. 
				<br>
				The use of headphones during the race is not permitted, due to the importance of being aware of your surroundings, and of messages conveyed during the races. Consumption of alcohol is not permitted on event grounds, along the trails, regarding both racers, and bystanders. 
				<br>
				The Melhus Marathon is a family-friendly event.</p>
